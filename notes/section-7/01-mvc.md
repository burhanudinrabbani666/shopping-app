## What is MVC

Separation of concern

MVS stand for Model Views Controllers

## Models

- Represent your data in your code
- Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)

## Views

- What the User sees
- Decoupled from your application code

## Controllers

- Connection your models and your Views
- Contains the "in-between" logic

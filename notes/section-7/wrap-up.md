## Warp up

### Model

- Responsible for representing yout data
- Resposible for managing yout data (saving, fetching..)
- Doesn't matter if you manage data in memory, file, database
- Contains data-related logic

### Views

- What the user sees
- Shouldn't contain too much logic

### Controller

- Connects Model Views
- Should only make sure that the two can communicate(in both directions)
